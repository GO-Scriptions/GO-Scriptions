This is an explanation of how to get data from an html form.

<form method="POST" action="/employeelogin">
        <label>Username:</label><br>
        <input type="text" name="nme"><br>

        <label>Password:</label><br>
        <input type="password" name="pw"><br>
        <br>

        <input type="submit" value="Login">
</form>

POST is the request method and action is where you want to submit the form to. 
The value of the name attribute is how you reference the field in your Go code.

You could get the name and password from the form like this:

func employeelogin(response http.ResponseWriter, request *http.Request) {

	name = request.FormValue("nme")
	password = request.FormValue("pw")

}
